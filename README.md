# THIS IS VERY VERY VERY Broken

I have not worked on this repository in a few weeks.
It contains about one hour of development so don't expect it to be anywhere near polished.
I will work on it again soon but I have school and not enough time currently. NOT
everything is my own! The theme work/style/design is my own! However the actual base of the website is not mine.
I have more of a background in web frameworks/designing the systems behind websites. 

I AM not the greatest at CSS/HTML/anything web design. I am still learning.
I am a C#/C++/Java Developer. So go easy on me.
